- Implemented CircVector class with methods for adding, removing, and accessing elements, including resizing and copy functionality.
- Developed LinkedList class with similar functionalities, including push, pop, and traversal methods.
- Created unit tests for both data structures using Google Test framework to ensure correctness of operations.
- Added main file for experimentation and a suppression file for known memory leaks on newer Macs.
